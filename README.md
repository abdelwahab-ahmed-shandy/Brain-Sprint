- `DataAccess/`: The layer responsible for storing and retrieving data (whether from files or databases).

- `Models/`: Contains the basic entities that represent the structure of challenges and solutions.
- `Relational Schema/`: Contains tables or schemas to link challenges to database concepts.
- `Services/`: The logic for implementing challenges (solutions, business logic, session management).
- `Utility/`: Commonly used helper functions.
